Description:
This game is a simple, never-ending game (think Flappy Bird, Nyan Cat, Jetpack Joyride, etc.). You will be a falling colored ball. Multiple hoops will appear from the bottom of the screen and you have to fall through every hoop of your respective color. The goal of this game is to try and drop as far as possible without missing too many hoops of your color.


Instructions:
Using the arrow keys, direct your ball to drop through hoops and get as far as you can. You begin with 3 lives. A life is lost if your ball fails to go through a hoop of your respective color (miss it entirely), if you hit one of the obstacles, or if you hit the left or right sides. You are not penalized for going through hoops of different colors. Power-ups can be obtained to help you.

PERIOD 1
1. Is there any penalty for going through the wrong color hoop?
2. This might be too little in the time given, and you may have to go through a lot of the want-to-haves
3. Even if different locations with the hoops is a stretch feature, you could could consider making different backgrounds with the same hoop locations


PERIOD 3




The dramatic death lol, depending on how it is orchestrated, could be difficult.


A “curse” power up could speed up the scrolling speed of the game to make it increasingly harder to get a highscore.
“More next page”


Powerups can slow down time, freeze hoops, allow the ball to “jump” up, or gain life, or even a teleport function that freezes the scrolling to allow to to teleport to a point.
